## Overview of Event Trigger Behavior

An event trigger fires whenever the event with which it is associated occurs in the database in which it is defined.
Currently, the supported events are `login`, `ddl_command_start`, `ddl_command_end`, `table_rewrite` and `sql_drop`.
Support for additional events may be added in future releases.

### login

The `login` event occurs when an authenticated user logs into the system.
Any bug in a trigger procedure for this event may prevent successful login to the system.
Such bugs may be worked around by setting [event_triggers (boolean)
      
       event_triggers
       configuration parameter](braised:ref/runtime-config-client#event-triggers-boolean-event-triggers-configuration-parameter) to `false` either in a connection string or configuration file. Alternatively, you can restart the system in single-user mode (as event triggers are disabled in this mode). See the [postgres](braised:ref/app-postgres) reference page for details about using single-user mode. The `login` event will also fire on standby servers. To prevent servers from becoming inaccessible, such triggers must avoid writing anything to the database when running on a standby. Also, it\'s recommended to avoid long-running queries in `login` event triggers. Note that, for instance, canceling a connection in psql will not cancel the in-progress `login` trigger.

For an example on how to use the `login` event trigger, see [A Database Login Event Trigger Example](braised:ref/event-trigger-database-login-example).

### ddl_command_start

The `ddl_command_start` event occurs just before the execution of a DDL command.
DDL commands in this context are:

-   `CREATE`

-   `ALTER`

-   `DROP`

-   `COMMENT`

-   `GRANT`

-   `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA`

-   `REINDEX`

-   `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`

-   `REVOKE`

-   `SECURITY LABEL`

`ddl_command_start` also occurs just before the execution of a `SELECT INTO` command, since this is equivalent to `CREATE TABLE AS`.

As an exception, this event does not occur for DDL commands targeting shared objects:

-   databases

-   roles (role definitions and role memberships)

-   tablespaces

-   parameter privileges

-   `ALTER SYSTEM`

This event also does not occur for commands targeting event triggers themselves.

No check whether the affected object exists or doesn\'t exist is performed before the event trigger fires.

### ddl_command_end

The `ddl_command_end` event occurs just after the execution of the same set of commands as `ddl_command_start`.
To obtain more details on the DDL operations that took place, use the set-returning function `pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands()` from the `ddl_command_end` event trigger code (see [Event Trigger Functions](braised:ref/functions-event-triggers)).
Note that the trigger fires after the actions have taken place (but before the transaction commits), and thus the system catalogs can be read as already changed.

### sql_drop

The `sql_drop` event occurs just before the `ddl_command_end` event trigger for any operation that drops database objects.
Note that besides the obvious `DROP` commands, some `ALTER` commands can also trigger an `sql_drop` event.

To list the objects that have been dropped, use the set-returning function `pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects()` from the `sql_drop` event trigger code (see [Event Trigger Functions](braised:ref/functions-event-triggers)).
Note that the trigger is executed after the objects have been deleted from the system catalogs, so it\'s not possible to look them up anymore.

### table_rewrite

The `table_rewrite` event occurs just before a table is rewritten by some actions of the commands `ALTER TABLE` and `ALTER TYPE`.
While other control statements are available to rewrite a table, like `CLUSTER` and `VACUUM`, the `table_rewrite` event is not triggered by them.
To find the OID of the table that was rewritten, use the function `pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_oid()`, to discover the reason(s) for the rewrite, use the function `pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_reason()` (see [Event Trigger Functions](braised:ref/functions-event-triggers)).

### Event Triggers in Aborted Transactions

Event triggers (like other functions) cannot be executed in an aborted transaction.
Thus, if a DDL command fails with an error, any associated `ddl_command_end` triggers will not be executed.
Conversely, if a `ddl_command_start` trigger fails with an error, no further event triggers will fire, and no attempt will be made to execute the command itself.
Similarly, if a `ddl_command_end` trigger fails with an error, the effects of the DDL statement will be rolled back, just as they would be in any other case where the containing transaction aborts.

### Creating Event Triggers

Event triggers are created using the command [CREATE EVENT TRIGGER](braised:ref/sql-createeventtrigger).
In order to create an event trigger, you must first create a function with the special return type `event_trigger`.
This function need not (and may not) return a value; the return type serves merely as a signal that the function is to be invoked as an event trigger.

If more than one event trigger is defined for a particular event, they will fire in alphabetical order by trigger name.

A trigger definition can also specify a `WHEN` condition so that, for example, a `ddl_command_start` trigger can be fired only for particular commands which the user wishes to intercept.
A common use of such triggers is to restrict the range of DDL operations which users may perform.
