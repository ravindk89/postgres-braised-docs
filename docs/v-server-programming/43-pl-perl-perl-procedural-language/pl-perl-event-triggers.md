PL/Perl can be used to write event trigger functions.
In an event trigger function, the hash reference `$_TD` contains information about the current trigger event. `$_TD` is a global variable, which gets a separate local value for each invocation of the trigger.
The fields of the `$_TD` hash reference are:

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`$_TD->{event}`"}
The name of the event the trigger is fired for.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`$_TD->{tag}`"}
The command tag for which the trigger is fired.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

The return value of the trigger function is ignored.

Here is an example of an event trigger function, illustrating some of the above:

    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION perlsnitch() RETURNS event_trigger AS $$
      elog(NOTICE, "perlsnitch: " . $_TD->{event} . " " . $_TD->{tag} . " ");
    $$ LANGUAGE plperl;

    CREATE EVENT TRIGGER perl_a_snitch
        ON ddl_command_start
        EXECUTE FUNCTION perlsnitch();
