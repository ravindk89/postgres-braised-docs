## Boolean Type

PostgreSQL provides the standard SQL type `boolean`; see Boolean Data Type.
The `boolean` type can have several states: "true", "false", and a third state, "unknown", which is represented by the SQL null value.

  : Boolean Data Type

Boolean constants can be represented in SQL queries by the SQL key words `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NULL`.

The datatype input function for type `boolean` accepts these string representations for the "true" state: `true`, `yes`, `on`, `1` and these representations for the "false" state: `false`, `no`, `off`, `0` Unique prefixes of these strings are also accepted, for example `t` or `n`. Leading or trailing whitespace is ignored, and case does not matter.

The datatype output function for type `boolean` always emits either `t` or `f`, as shown in example.

    CREATE TABLE test1 (a boolean, b text);
    INSERT INTO test1 VALUES (TRUE, 'sic est');
    INSERT INTO test1 VALUES (FALSE, 'non est');
    SELECT * FROM test1;
     a |    b
    ---+---------
     t | sic est
     f | non est

    SELECT * FROM test1 WHERE a;
     a |    b
    ---+---------
     t | sic est

The key words `TRUE` and `FALSE` are the preferred (SQL-compliant) method for writing Boolean constants in SQL queries. But you can also use the string representations by following the generic string-literal constant syntax described in [Constants of Other Types](braised:ref/sql-syntax-lexical#constants-of-other-types), for example `'yes'::boolean`.

Note that the parser automatically understands that `TRUE` and `FALSE` are of type `boolean`, but this is not so for `NULL` because that can have any type. So in some contexts you might have to cast `NULL` to `boolean` explicitly, for example `NULL::boolean`. Conversely, the cast can be omitted from a string-literal Boolean value in contexts where the parser can deduce that the literal must be of type `boolean`.
