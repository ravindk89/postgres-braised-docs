SQL statements can, intentionally or not, require the mixing of different data types in the same expression.
PostgreSQL has extensive facilities for evaluating mixed-type expressions.

In many cases a user does not need to understand the details of the type conversion mechanism.
However, implicit conversions done by PostgreSQL can affect the results of a query.
When necessary, these results can be tailored by using *explicit* type conversion.

This chapter introduces the PostgreSQL type conversion mechanisms and conventions.
Refer to the relevant sections in [8. Data Types](braised:ref/datatype) and [9.
Functions and Operators](braised:ref/functions) for more information on specific data types and allowed functions and operators.
