DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY [ IF EXISTS ] name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
:::

## Description

`DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY` drops an existing text search dictionary.
To execute this command you must be the owner of the dictionary.

## Parameters

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`IF EXISTS`"}
Do not throw an error if the text search dictionary does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*name*"}
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing text search dictionary.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`CASCADE`"}
Automatically drop objects that depend on the text search dictionary, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Dependency Tracking](braised:ref/ddl-depend)).
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`RESTRICT`"}
Refuse to drop the text search dictionary if any objects depend on it. This is the default.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Examples

Remove the text search dictionary `english`:

    DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY english;

This command will not succeed if there are any existing text search configurations that use the dictionary.
Add `CASCADE` to drop such configurations along with the dictionary.

## Compatibility

There is no `DROP TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY` statement in the SQL standard.
