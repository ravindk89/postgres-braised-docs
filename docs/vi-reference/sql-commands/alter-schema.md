## Description

`ALTER SCHEMA` changes the definition of a schema.

You must own the schema to use `ALTER SCHEMA`.
To rename a schema you must also have the `CREATE` privilege for the database.
To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and that role must have the `CREATE` privilege for the database. (Note that superusers have all these privileges automatically.)

## Parameters

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="*name*"}
The name of an existing schema.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*new_name*"}
The new name of the schema. The new name cannot begin with `pg_`, as such names are reserved for system schemas.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*new_owner*"}
The new owner of the schema.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Compatibility

There is no `ALTER SCHEMA` statement in the SQL standard.
