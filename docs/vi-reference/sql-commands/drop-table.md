DROP TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
:::

## Description

`DROP TABLE` removes tables from the database.
Only the table owner, the schema owner, and superuser can drop a table.
To empty a table of rows without destroying the table, use [`DELETE`](#sql-delete) or [`TRUNCATE`](#sql-truncate).

`DROP TABLE` always removes any indexes, rules, triggers, and constraints that exist for the target table.
However, to drop a table that is referenced by a view or a foreign-key constraint of another table, `CASCADE` must be specified. (`CASCADE` will remove a dependent view entirely, but in the foreign-key case it will only remove the foreign-key constraint, not the other table entirely.)

## Parameters

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`IF EXISTS`"}
Do not throw an error if the table does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*name*"}
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to drop.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`CASCADE`"}
Automatically drop objects that depend on the table (such as views), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Dependency Tracking](braised:ref/ddl-depend)).
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`RESTRICT`"}
Refuse to drop the table if any objects depend on it. This is the default.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Examples

To destroy two tables, `films` and `distributors`:

    DROP TABLE films, distributors;

## Compatibility

This command conforms to the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one table to be dropped per command, and apart from the `IF EXISTS` option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
