## Description

`ALTER OPERATOR` changes the definition of an operator.

You must own the operator to use `ALTER OPERATOR`.
To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the operator\'s schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn\'t do anything you couldn\'t do by dropping and recreating the operator.
However, a superuser can alter ownership of any operator anyway.)

## Parameters

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="*name*"}
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*left_type*"}
The data type of the operator\'s left operand; write `NONE` if the operator has no left operand.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*right_type*"}
The data type of the operator\'s right operand.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*new_owner*"}
The new owner of the operator.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*new_schema*"}
The new schema for the operator.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*res_proc*"}
The restriction selectivity estimator function for this operator; write NONE to remove existing selectivity estimator.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*join_proc*"}
The join selectivity estimator function for this operator; write NONE to remove existing selectivity estimator.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*com_op*"}
The commutator of this operator. Can only be changed if the operator does not have an existing commutator.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="*neg_op*"}
The negator of this operator. Can only be changed if the operator does not have an existing negator.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`HASHES`"}
Indicates this operator can support a hash join. Can only be enabled and not disabled.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`MERGES`"}
Indicates this operator can support a merge join. Can only be enabled and not disabled.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Notes

Refer to [User-Defined Operators](braised:ref/xoper) and [Operator Optimization Information](braised:ref/xoper-optimization) for further information.

Since commutators come in pairs that are commutators of each other, `ALTER OPERATOR SET COMMUTATOR` will also set the commutator of the *com_op* to be the target operator.
Likewise, `ALTER OPERATOR SET NEGATOR` will also set the negator of the *neg_op* to be the target operator.
Therefore, you must own the commutator or negator operator as well as the target operator.

## Examples

Change the owner of a custom operator `a @@ b` for type `text`:

    ALTER OPERATOR @@ (text, text) OWNER TO joe;

Change the restriction and join selectivity estimator functions of a custom operator `a && b` for type `int[]`:

    ALTER OPERATOR && (int[], int[]) SET (RESTRICT = _int_contsel, JOIN = _int_contjoinsel);

Mark the `&&` operator as being its own commutator:

    ALTER OPERATOR && (int[], int[]) SET (COMMUTATOR = &&);

## Compatibility

There is no `ALTER OPERATOR` statement in the SQL standard.
