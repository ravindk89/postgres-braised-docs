title: "27.4. Progress Reporting"
id: progress-reporting
---

PostgreSQL has the ability to report the progress of certain commands during command execution.
Currently, the only commands which support progress reporting are `ANALYZE`, `CLUSTER`, `CREATE INDEX`, `VACUUM`, `COPY`, and [BASE_BACKUP [ ( option [, ...] ) ]
      BASE_BACKUP](braised:ref/protocol-replication#base-backup-option-base-backup) (i.e., replication command that [pg_basebackup](braised:ref/app-pgbasebackup) issues to take a base backup). This may be expanded in the future.

### ANALYZE Progress Reporting

Whenever `ANALYZE` is running, the pg_stat_progress_analyze view will contain a row for each backend that is currently running that command.
The tables below describe the information that will be reported and provide information about how to interpret it.

  : ANALYZE Phases

:::{.callout type="note"}
Note that when `ANALYZE` is run on a partitioned table without the `ONLY` keyword, all of its partitions are also recursively analyzed. In that case, `ANALYZE` progress is reported first for the parent table, whereby its inheritance statistics are collected, followed by that for each partition.

:::{/table}

  `waiting for writers before build`          `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` or `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` is waiting for transactions with write locks that can potentially see the table to finish. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns lockers_total, lockers_done and current_locker_pid contain the progress information for this phase.

  `building index`                            The index is being built by the access method-specific code. In this phase, access methods that support progress reporting fill in their own progress data, and the subphase is indicated in this column. Typically, blocks_total and blocks_done will contain progress data, as well as potentially tuples_total and tuples_done.

  `waiting for writers before validation`     `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` or `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` is waiting for transactions with write locks that can potentially write into the table to finish. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns lockers_total, lockers_done and current_locker_pid contain the progress information for this phase.

  `index validation: scanning index`          `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is scanning the index searching for tuples that need to be validated. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns blocks_total (set to the total size of the index) and blocks_done contain the progress information for this phase.

  `index validation: sorting tuples`          `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is sorting the output of the index scanning phase.

  `index validation: scanning table`          `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is scanning the table to validate the index tuples collected in the previous two phases. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns blocks_total (set to the total size of the table) and blocks_done contain the progress information for this phase.

  `waiting for old snapshots`                 `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` or `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` is waiting for transactions that can potentially see the table to release their snapshots. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns lockers_total, lockers_done and current_locker_pid contain the progress information for this phase.

  `waiting for readers before marking dead`   `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` is waiting for transactions with read locks on the table to finish, before marking the old index dead. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns lockers_total, lockers_done and current_locker_pid contain the progress information for this phase.

  `waiting for readers before dropping`       `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` is waiting for transactions with read locks on the table to finish, before dropping the old index. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns lockers_total, lockers_done and current_locker_pid contain the progress information for this phase.

### VACUUM Progress Reporting

Whenever `VACUUM` is running, the pg_stat_progress_vacuum view will contain one row for each backend (including autovacuum worker processes) that is currently vacuuming. The tables below describe the information that will be reported and provide information about how to interpret it. Progress for `VACUUM FULL` commands is reported via pg_stat_progress_cluster because both `VACUUM FULL` and `CLUSTER` rewrite the table, while regular `VACUUM` only modifies it in place. See [CLUSTER Progress Reporting](#cluster-progress-reporting).

:::{.table}
  :::{.row header="true"}
  :::{.cell}
   Column Type

   Description
  :::{/cell}

  :::{/cell}
  :::{/row}
  :::{.row}
  :::{.cell}
   heap_blks_total `bigint`

   Total number of heap blocks in the table. This number is reported as of the beginning of the scan; blocks added later will not be (and need not be) visited by this `VACUUM`.
  :::{/cell}
  :::{/row}
  :::{.row}
  :::{.cell}
   heap_blks_scanned `bigint`

   Number of heap blocks scanned. Because the [visibility map](#storage-vm) is used to optimize scans, some blocks will be skipped without inspection; skipped blocks are included in this total, so that this number will eventually become equal to heap_blks_total when the vacuum is complete. This counter only advances when the phase is `scanning heap`.
  :::{/cell}
  :::{/row}
  :::{.row}
  :::{.cell}
   heap_blks_vacuumed `bigint`

   Number of heap blocks vacuumed. Unless the table has no indexes, this counter only advances when the phase is `vacuuming heap`. Blocks that contain no dead tuples are skipped, so the counter may sometimes skip forward in large increments.
  :::{/cell}
  :::{/row}
  :::{.row}
  :::{.cell}
   index_vacuum_count `bigint`

   Number of completed index vacuum cycles.
  :::{/cell}
  :::{/row}

  :::{.cell}
   max_dead_tuple_bytes `bigint`

   Amount of dead tuple data that we can store before needing to perform an index vacuum cycle, based on [maintenance_work_mem (integer)
      
       maintenance_work_mem configuration parameter](braised:ref/runtime-config-resource#maintenance-work-mem-integer-maintenance-work-mem-configuration-parameter).
  :::{/cell}
  :::{/row}

   indexes_total `bigint`

   Total number of indexes that will be vacuumed or cleaned up. This number is reported at the beginning of the `vacuuming indexes` phase or the `cleaning up indexes` phase.
  :::{/cell}
  :::{/row}
  :::{.row}
  :::{.cell}
   indexes_processed `bigint`

   Number of indexes processed. This counter only advances when the phase is `vacuuming indexes` or `cleaning up indexes`.
  :::{/cell}

  :::{.row}
  :::{.cell}
   delay_time `double precision`

   Total time spent sleeping due to cost-based delay (see [Cost-based Vacuum Delay](braised:ref/runtime-config-vacuum#cost-based-vacuum-delay)), in milliseconds (if [track_cost_delay_timing (boolean)
      
       track_cost_delay_timing configuration parameter](braised:ref/runtime-config-statistics#track-cost-delay-timing-boolean-track-cost-delay-timing-configuration-parameter) is enabled, otherwise zero). This includes the time that any associated parallel workers have slept. However, parallel workers report their sleep time no more frequently than once per second, so the reported value may be slightly stale.

  `VACUUM` is preparing to begin scanning the heap. This phase is expected to be very brief.
  :::{/cell}
  :::{/row}
:::{/table}

  `scanning heap`              `VACUUM` is currently scanning the heap. It will prune and defragment each page if required, and possibly perform freezing activity. The heap_blks_scanned column can be used to monitor the progress of the scan.

  `vacuuming indexes`          `VACUUM` is currently vacuuming the indexes. If a table has any indexes, this will happen at least once per vacuum, after the heap has been completely scanned. It may happen multiple times per vacuum if [maintenance_work_mem (integer)
      
       maintenance_work_mem configuration parameter](braised:ref/runtime-config-resource#maintenance-work-mem-integer-maintenance-work-mem-configuration-parameter) (or, in the case of autovacuum, [autovacuum_work_mem (integer)
      
       autovacuum_work_mem configuration parameter](braised:ref/runtime-config-resource#autovacuum-work-mem-integer-autovacuum-work-mem-configuration-parameter) if set) is insufficient to store the number of dead tuples found.

  `vacuuming heap`             `VACUUM` is currently vacuuming the heap. Vacuuming the heap is distinct from scanning the heap, and occurs after each instance of vacuuming indexes. If heap_blks_scanned is less than heap_blks_total, the system will return to scanning the heap after this phase is completed; otherwise, it will begin cleaning up indexes after this phase is completed.

  `cleaning up indexes`        `VACUUM` is currently cleaning up indexes. This occurs after the heap has been completely scanned and all vacuuming of the indexes and the heap has been completed.

  `truncating heap`            `VACUUM` is currently truncating the heap so as to return empty pages at the end of the relation to the operating system. This occurs after cleaning up indexes.

  `performing final cleanup`   `VACUUM` is performing final cleanup. During this phase, `VACUUM` will vacuum the free space map, update statistics in `pg_class`, and report statistics to the cumulative statistics system. When this phase is completed, `VACUUM` will end.

   backup_total `bigint`

   Total amount of data that will be streamed. This is estimated and reported as of the beginning of `streaming database files` phase. Note that this is only an approximation since the database may change during `streaming database files` phase and WAL log may be included in the backup later. This is always the same value as backup_streamed once the amount of data streamed exceeds the estimated total size. If the estimation is disabled in pg_basebackup (i.e., `--no-estimate-size` option is specified), this is `NULL`.

  `initializing`
  :::{/cell}

  The WAL sender process is preparing to begin the backup. This phase is expected to be very brief.
  :::{/cell}
  :::{/row}
:::{/table}

  `waiting for checkpoint to finish`      The WAL sender process is currently performing `pg_backup_start` to prepare to take a base backup, and waiting for the start-of-backup checkpoint to finish.

  `estimating backup size`                The WAL sender process is currently estimating the total amount of database files that will be streamed as a base backup.

  `streaming database files`              The WAL sender process is currently streaming database files as a base backup.

  `waiting for wal archiving to finish`   The WAL sender process is currently performing `pg_backup_stop` to finish the backup, and waiting for all the WAL files required for the base backup to be successfully archived. If either `--wal-method=none` or `--wal-method=stream` is specified in pg_basebackup, the backup will end when this phase is completed.

  `transferring wal files`                The WAL sender process is currently transferring all WAL logs generated during the backup. This phase occurs after `waiting for wal archiving to finish` phase if `--wal-method=fetch` is specified in pg_basebackup. The backup will end when this phase is completed.
