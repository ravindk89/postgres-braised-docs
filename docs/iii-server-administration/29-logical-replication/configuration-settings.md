## Configuration Settings

Logical replication requires several configuration options to be set.
These options are relevant only on one side of the replication.

### Publishers

`wal_level` must be set to `logical`.

`max_replication_slots` must be set to at least the number of subscriptions expected to connect, plus some reserve for table synchronization.

Logical replication slots are also affected by `idle_replication_slot_timeout`.

`max_wal_senders` should be set to at least the same as `max_replication_slots`, plus the number of physical replicas that are connected at the same time.

Logical replication walsender is also affected by `wal_sender_timeout`.

### Subscribers

`max_active_replication_origins` must be set to at least the number of subscriptions that will be added to the subscriber, plus some reserve for table synchronization.

`max_logical_replication_workers` must be set to at least the number of subscriptions (for leader apply workers), plus some reserve for the table synchronization workers and parallel apply workers.

`max_worker_processes` may need to be adjusted to accommodate for replication workers, at least (`max_logical_replication_workers` + `1`).
Note, some extensions and parallel queries also take worker slots from `max_worker_processes`.

`max_sync_workers_per_subscription` controls the amount of parallelism of the initial data copy during the subscription initialization or when new tables are added.

`max_parallel_apply_workers_per_subscription` controls the amount of parallelism for streaming of in-progress transactions with subscription parameter `streaming = parallel`.

Logical replication workers are also affected by `wal_receiver_timeout`, `wal_receiver_status_interval` and `wal_retrieve_retry_interval`.
