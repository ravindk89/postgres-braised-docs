## Lock Management

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`deadlock_timeout` (`integer`)"}
This is the amount of time to wait on a lock before checking to see if there is a deadlock condition. The check for deadlock is relatively expensive, so the server doesn\'t run it every time it waits for a lock. We optimistically assume that deadlocks are not common in production applications and just wait on the lock for a while before checking for a deadlock. Increasing this value reduces the amount of time wasted in needless deadlock checks, but slows down reporting of real deadlock errors. If this value is specified without units, it is taken as milliseconds. The default is one second (`1s`), which is probably about the smallest value you would want in practice. On a heavily loaded server you might want to raise it. Ideally the setting should exceed your typical transaction time, so as to improve the odds that a lock will be released before the waiter decides to check for deadlock. Only superusers and users with the appropriate `SET` privilege can change this setting.

When [log_lock_waits (boolean)
      
   log_lock_waits configuration parameter](braised:ref/runtime-config-logging#log-lock-waits-boolean-log-lock-waits-configuration-parameter) is set, this parameter also determines the amount of time to wait before a log message is issued about the lock wait. If you are trying to investigate locking delays you might want to set a shorter than normal `deadlock_timeout`.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`max_locks_per_transaction` (`integer`)"}
The shared lock table has space for `max_locks_per_transaction` objects (e.g., tables) per server process or prepared transaction; hence, no more than this many distinct objects can be locked at any one time. This parameter limits the average number of object locks used by each transaction; individual transactions can lock more objects as long as the locks of all transactions fit in the lock table. This is *not* the number of rows that can be locked; that value is unlimited. The default, 64, has historically proven sufficient, but you might need to raise this value if you have queries that touch many different tables in a single transaction, e.g., query of a parent table with many children. This parameter can only be set at server start.

When running a standby server, you must set this parameter to have the same or higher value as on the primary server. Otherwise, queries will not be allowed in the standby server.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`max_pred_locks_per_transaction` (`integer`)"}
The shared predicate lock table has space for `max_pred_locks_per_transaction` objects (e.g., tables) per server process or prepared transaction; hence, no more than this many distinct objects can be locked at any one time. This parameter limits the average number of object locks used by each transaction; individual transactions can lock more objects as long as the locks of all transactions fit in the lock table. This is *not* the number of rows that can be locked; that value is unlimited. The default, 64, has historically proven sufficient, but you might need to raise this value if you have clients that touch many different tables in a single serializable transaction. This parameter can only be set at server start.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`max_pred_locks_per_relation` (`integer`)"}
This controls how many pages or tuples of a single relation can be predicate-locked before the lock is promoted to covering the whole relation. Values greater than or equal to zero mean an absolute limit, while negative values mean max_pred_locks_per_transaction divided by the absolute value of this setting. The default is -2, which keeps the behavior from previous versions of PostgreSQL. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`max_pred_locks_per_page` (`integer`)"}
This controls how many rows on a single page can be predicate-locked before the lock is promoted to covering the whole page. The default is 2. This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.
