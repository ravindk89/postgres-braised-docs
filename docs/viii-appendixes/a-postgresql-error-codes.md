# PostgreSQL Error Codes

All messages emitted by the PostgreSQL server are assigned five-character error codes that follow the SQL standard\'s conventions for "SQLSTATE" codes.
Applications that need to know which error condition has occurred should usually test the error code, rather than looking at the textual error message.
The error codes are less likely to change across PostgreSQL releases, and also are not subject to change due to localization of error messages.
Note that some, but not all, of the error codes produced by PostgreSQL are defined by the SQL standard; some additional error codes for conditions not defined by the standard have been invented or borrowed from other databases.

According to the standard, the first two characters of an error code denote a class of errors, while the last three characters indicate a specific condition within that class.
Thus, an application that does not recognize the specific error code might still be able to infer what to do from the error class.

Error Codes lists all the error codes defined in PostgreSQL . (Some are not actually used at present, but are defined by the SQL standard.) The error classes are also shown.
For each error class there is a "standard" error code having the last three characters `000`.
This code is used only for error conditions that fall within the class but do not have any more-specific code assigned.

The symbol shown in the column "Condition Name" is the condition name to use in PL/pgSQL.
Condition names can be written in either upper or lower case. (Note that PL/pgSQL does not recognize warning, as opposed to error, condition names; those are classes 00, 01, and 02.)

For some types of errors, the server reports the name of a database object (a table, table column, data type, or constraint) associated with the error; for example, the name of the unique constraint that caused a `unique_violation` error.
Such names are supplied in separate fields of the error report message so that applications need not try to extract them from the possibly-localized human-readable text of the message.
As of PostgreSQL 9.3, complete coverage for this feature exists only for errors in SQLSTATE class 23 (integrity constraint violation), but this is likely to be expanded in future.
