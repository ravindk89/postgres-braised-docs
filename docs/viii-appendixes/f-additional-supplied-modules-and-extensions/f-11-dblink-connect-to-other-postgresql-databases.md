## dblink connect to other PostgreSQL databases

`dblink` is a module that supports connections to other PostgreSQL databases from within a database session.

`dblink` can report the following wait events under the wait event type `Extension`.

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`DblinkConnect`"}
Waiting to establish a connection to a remote server.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`DblinkGetConnect`"}
Waiting to establish a connection to a remote server when it could not be found in the list of already-opened connections.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`DblinkGetResult`"}
Waiting to receive the results of a query from a remote server.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

See also [F.38. postgres_fdw — access data stored in external PostgreSQL servers](braised:ref/postgres-fdw), which provides roughly the same functionality using a more modern and standards-compliant infrastructure.

dblink_connect

dblink_connect

opens a persistent connection to a remote database

dblink_connect(text connstr) returns text dblink_connect(text connname, text connstr) returns text

## Description

`dblink_connect()` establishes a connection to a remote PostgreSQL database.
The server and database to be contacted are identified through a standard libpq connection string.
Optionally, a name can be assigned to the connection.
Multiple named connections can be open at once, but only one unnamed connection is permitted at a time.
The connection will persist until closed or until the database session is ended.

The connection string may also be the name of an existing foreign server.
It is recommended to use the foreign-data wrapper `dblink_fdw` when defining the foreign server.
See the example below, as well as [CREATE SERVER](braised:ref/sql-createserver) and [CREATE USER MAPPING](braised:ref/sql-createusermapping).

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
The name to use for this connection; if omitted, an unnamed connection is opened, replacing any existing unnamed connection.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`connstr`"}
libpq-style connection info string, for example `hostaddr=127.0.0.1 port=5432 dbname=mydb user=postgres password=mypasswd options=-csearch_path=`. For details see [Connection Strings](braised:ref/libpq-connect#connection-strings). Alternatively, the name of a foreign server.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns status, which is always `OK` (since any error causes the function to throw an error instead of returning).

## Notes

If untrusted users have access to a database that has not adopted a [secure schema usage pattern](#ddl-schemas-patterns), begin each session by removing publicly-writable schemas from `search_path`.
One could, for example, add `options=-csearch_path=` to `connstr`.
This consideration is not specific to `dblink`; it applies to every interface for executing arbitrary SQL commands.

The foreign-data wrapper `dblink_fdw` has an additional Boolean option `use_scram_passthrough` that controls whether `dblink` will use the SCRAM pass-through authentication to connect to the remote database.
With SCRAM pass-through authentication, `dblink` uses SCRAM-hashed secrets instead of plain-text user passwords to connect to the remote server.
This avoids storing plain-text user passwords in PostgreSQL system catalogs.
See the documentation of the equivalent [`use_scram_passthrough`](#postgres-fdw-option-use-scram-passthrough) option of postgres_fdw for further details and restrictions.

Only superusers may use `dblink_connect` to create connections that use neither password authentication, SCRAM pass-through, nor GSSAPI-authentication.
If non-superusers need this capability, use `dblink_connect_u` instead.

It is unwise to choose connection names that contain equal signs, as this opens a risk of confusion with connection info strings in other `dblink` functions.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_connect('dbname=postgres options=-csearch_path=');
     dblink_connect
    ----------------
     OK
    (1 row)

    SELECT dblink_connect('myconn', 'dbname=postgres options=-csearch_path=');
     dblink_connect
    ----------------
     OK
    (1 row)

    -- FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER functionality
    -- Note: local connections that don't use SCRAM pass-through require password
    --       authentication for this to work properly. Otherwise, you will receive
    --       the following error from dblink_connect():
    --       ERROR:  password is required
    --       DETAIL:  Non-superuser cannot connect if the server does not request a password.
    --       HINT:  Target server's authentication method must be changed.

    CREATE SERVER fdtest FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER dblink_fdw OPTIONS (hostaddr '127.0.0.1', dbname 'contrib_regression');

    CREATE USER regress_dblink_user WITH PASSWORD 'secret';
    CREATE USER MAPPING FOR regress_dblink_user SERVER fdtest OPTIONS (user 'regress_dblink_user', password 'secret');
    GRANT USAGE ON FOREIGN SERVER fdtest TO regress_dblink_user;
    GRANT SELECT ON TABLE foo TO regress_dblink_user;

    \set ORIGINAL_USER :USER
    \c - regress_dblink_user
    SELECT dblink_connect('myconn', 'fdtest');
     dblink_connect
    ----------------
     OK
    (1 row)

    SELECT * FROM dblink('myconn', 'SELECT * FROM foo') AS t(a int, b text, c text[]);
     a  | b |       c

    DROP USER regress_dblink_user;
    DROP SERVER fdtest;

dblink_connect_u

3

dblink_connect_u

opens a persistent connection to a remote database, insecurely

dblink_connect_u(text connstr) returns text dblink_connect_u(text connname, text connstr) returns text

## Description

`dblink_connect_u()` is identical to `dblink_connect()`, except that it will allow non-superusers to connect using any authentication method.

If the remote server selects an authentication method that does not involve a password, then impersonation and subsequent escalation of privileges can occur, because the session will appear to have originated from the user as which the local PostgreSQL server runs.
Also, even if the remote server does demand a password, it is possible for the password to be supplied from the server environment, such as a `~/.pgpass` file belonging to the server\'s user.
This opens not only a risk of impersonation, but the possibility of exposing a password to an untrustworthy remote server.
Therefore, `dblink_connect_u()` is initially installed with all privileges revoked from `PUBLIC`, making it un-callable except by superusers.
In some situations it may be appropriate to grant `EXECUTE` permission for `dblink_connect_u()` to specific users who are considered trustworthy, but this should be done with care.
It is also recommended that any `~/.pgpass` file belonging to the server\'s user *not* contain any records specifying a wildcard host name.

For further details see `dblink_connect()`.

dblink_disconnect

3

dblink_disconnect

closes a persistent connection to a remote database

dblink_disconnect() returns text dblink_disconnect(text connname) returns text

## Description

`dblink_disconnect()` closes a connection previously opened by `dblink_connect()`.
The form with no arguments closes an unnamed connection.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
The name of a named connection to be closed.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns status, which is always `OK` (since any error causes the function to throw an error instead of returning).

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_disconnect();
     dblink_disconnect
    -------------------
     OK
    (1 row)

    SELECT dblink_disconnect('myconn');
     dblink_disconnect
    -------------------
     OK
    (1 row)

dblink

3

dblink

executes a query in a remote database

dblink(text connname, text sql \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns setof record dblink(text connstr, text sql \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns setof record dblink(text sql \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns setof record

## Description

`dblink` executes a query (usually a `SELECT`, but it can be any SQL statement that returns rows) in a remote database.

When two `text` arguments are given, the first one is first looked up as a persistent connection\'s name; if found, the command is executed on that connection.
If not found, the first argument is treated as a connection info string as for `dblink_connect`, and the indicated connection is made just for the duration of this command.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
Name of the connection to use; omit this parameter to use the unnamed connection.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`connstr`"}
A connection info string, as previously described for `dblink_connect`.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`sql`"}
The SQL query that you wish to execute in the remote database, for example `select * from foo`.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`fail_on_error`"}
If true (the default when omitted) then an error thrown on the remote side of the connection causes an error to also be thrown locally. If false, the remote error is locally reported as a NOTICE, and the function returns no rows.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

The function returns the row(s) produced by the query.
Since `dblink` can be used with any query, it is declared to return `record`, rather than specifying any particular set of columns.
This means that you must specify the expected set of columns in the calling query otherwise PostgreSQL would not know what to expect.
Here is an example:

    SELECT *
        FROM dblink('dbname=mydb options=-csearch_path=',
                    'select proname, prosrc from pg_proc')
          AS t1(proname name, prosrc text)
        WHERE proname LIKE 'bytea%';

The "alias" part of the `FROM` clause must specify the column names and types that the function will return. (Specifying column names in an alias is actually standard SQL syntax, but specifying column types is a PostgreSQL extension.) This allows the system to understand what `*` should expand to, and what proname in the `WHERE` clause refers to, in advance of trying to execute the function.
At run time, an error will be thrown if the actual query result from the remote database does not have the same number of columns shown in the `FROM` clause.
The column names need not match, however, and `dblink` does not insist on exact type matches either.
It will succeed so long as the returned data strings are valid input for the column type declared in the `FROM` clause.

## Notes

A convenient way to use `dblink` with predetermined queries is to create a view.
This allows the column type information to be buried in the view, instead of having to spell it out in every query.
For example,

    CREATE VIEW myremote_pg_proc AS
      SELECT *
        FROM dblink('dbname=postgres options=-csearch_path=',
                    'select proname, prosrc from pg_proc')
        AS t1(proname name, prosrc text);

    SELECT * FROM myremote_pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE 'bytea%';

## Examples

    SELECT * FROM dblink('dbname=postgres options=-csearch_path=',
                         'select proname, prosrc from pg_proc')
      AS t1(proname name, prosrc text) WHERE proname LIKE 'bytea%';
      proname   |   prosrc

    (1 row)

    SELECT * FROM dblink('select proname, prosrc from pg_proc')
      AS t1(proname name, prosrc text) WHERE proname LIKE 'bytea%';

dblink_exec

3

dblink_exec

executes a command in a remote database

dblink_exec(text connname, text sql \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns text dblink_exec(text connstr, text sql \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns text dblink_exec(text sql \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns text

## Description

`dblink_exec` executes a command (that is, any SQL statement that doesn\'t return rows) in a remote database.

When two `text` arguments are given, the first one is first looked up as a persistent connection\'s name; if found, the command is executed on that connection.
If not found, the first argument is treated as a connection info string as for `dblink_connect`, and the indicated connection is made just for the duration of this command.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
Name of the connection to use; omit this parameter to use the unnamed connection.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`connstr`"}
A connection info string, as previously described for `dblink_connect`.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`sql`"}
The SQL command that you wish to execute in the remote database, for example `insert into foo values(0, 'a', '{"a0","b0","c0"}')`.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`fail_on_error`"}
If true (the default when omitted) then an error thrown on the remote side of the connection causes an error to also be thrown locally. If false, the remote error is locally reported as a NOTICE, and the function\'s return value is set to `ERROR`.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns status, either the command\'s status string or `ERROR`.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_connect('dbname=dblink_test_standby');
     dblink_connect
    ----------------
     OK
    (1 row)

    SELECT dblink_exec('insert into foo values(21, ''z'', ''{"a0","b0","c0"}'');');
       dblink_exec
    -----------------
     INSERT 943366 1
    (1 row)

    SELECT dblink_connect('myconn', 'dbname=regression');
     dblink_connect
    ----------------
     OK
    (1 row)

    SELECT dblink_exec('myconn', 'insert into foo values(21, ''z'', ''{"a0","b0","c0"}'');');
       dblink_exec
    ------------------
     INSERT 6432584 1
    (1 row)

    SELECT dblink_exec('myconn', 'insert into pg_class values (''foo'')',false);
    NOTICE:  sql error
    DETAIL:  ERROR:  null value in column "relnamespace" violates not-null constraint

     dblink_exec
    -------------
     ERROR
    (1 row)

dblink_open

3

dblink_open

opens a cursor in a remote database

dblink_open(text cursorname, text sql \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns text dblink_open(text connname, text cursorname, text sql \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns text

## Description

`dblink_open()` opens a cursor in a remote database.
The cursor can subsequently be manipulated with `dblink_fetch()` and `dblink_close()`.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
Name of the connection to use; omit this parameter to use the unnamed connection.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`cursorname`"}
The name to assign to this cursor.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`sql`"}
The `SELECT` statement that you wish to execute in the remote database, for example `select * from pg_class`.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`fail_on_error`"}
If true (the default when omitted) then an error thrown on the remote side of the connection causes an error to also be thrown locally. If false, the remote error is locally reported as a NOTICE, and the function\'s return value is set to `ERROR`.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns status, either `OK` or `ERROR`.

## Notes

Since a cursor can only persist within a transaction, `dblink_open` starts an explicit transaction block (`BEGIN`) on the remote side, if the remote side was not already within a transaction.
This transaction will be closed again when the matching `dblink_close` is executed.
Note that if you use `dblink_exec` to change data between `dblink_open` and `dblink_close`, and then an error occurs or you use `dblink_disconnect` before `dblink_close`, your change *will be lost* because the transaction will be aborted.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_connect('dbname=postgres options=-csearch_path=');
     dblink_connect
    ----------------
     OK
    (1 row)

    SELECT dblink_open('foo', 'select proname, prosrc from pg_proc');
     dblink_open
    -------------
     OK
    (1 row)

dblink_fetch

3

dblink_fetch

returns rows from an open cursor in a remote database

dblink_fetch(text cursorname, int howmany \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns setof record dblink_fetch(text connname, text cursorname, int howmany \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns setof record

## Description

`dblink_fetch` fetches rows from a cursor previously established by `dblink_open`.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
Name of the connection to use; omit this parameter to use the unnamed connection.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`cursorname`"}
The name of the cursor to fetch from.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`howmany`"}
The maximum number of rows to retrieve. The next `howmany` rows are fetched, starting at the current cursor position, moving forward. Once the cursor has reached its end, no more rows are produced.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`fail_on_error`"}
If true (the default when omitted) then an error thrown on the remote side of the connection causes an error to also be thrown locally. If false, the remote error is locally reported as a NOTICE, and the function returns no rows.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

The function returns the row(s) fetched from the cursor.
To use this function, you will need to specify the expected set of columns, as previously discussed for `dblink`.

## Notes

On a mismatch between the number of return columns specified in the `FROM` clause, and the actual number of columns returned by the remote cursor, an error will be thrown.
In this event, the remote cursor is still advanced by as many rows as it would have been if the error had not occurred.
The same is true for any other error occurring in the local query after the remote `FETCH` has been done.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_connect('dbname=postgres options=-csearch_path=');
     dblink_connect
    ----------------
     OK
    (1 row)

    SELECT dblink_open('foo', 'select proname, prosrc from pg_proc where proname like ''bytea%''');
     dblink_open
    -------------
     OK
    (1 row)

    SELECT * FROM dblink_fetch('foo', 5) AS (funcname name, source text);
     funcname |  source
    ----------+----------
     byteacat | byteacat
     byteacmp | byteacmp
     byteaeq  | byteaeq
     byteage  | byteage
     byteagt  | byteagt
    (5 rows)

    SELECT * FROM dblink_fetch('foo', 5) AS (funcname name, source text);
     funcname  |  source
    -----------+-----------
     byteain   | byteain
     byteale   | byteale
     bytealike | bytealike
     bytealt   | bytealt
     byteane   | byteane
    (5 rows)

    SELECT * FROM dblink_fetch('foo', 5) AS (funcname name, source text);
      funcname  |   source
    ------------+------------
     byteanlike | byteanlike
     byteaout   | byteaout
    (2 rows)

    SELECT * FROM dblink_fetch('foo', 5) AS (funcname name, source text);
     funcname | source
    ----------+--------
    (0 rows)

dblink_close

3

dblink_close

closes a cursor in a remote database

dblink_close(text cursorname \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns text dblink_close(text connname, text cursorname \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns text

## Description

`dblink_close` closes a cursor previously opened with `dblink_open`.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
Name of the connection to use; omit this parameter to use the unnamed connection.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`cursorname`"}
The name of the cursor to close.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`fail_on_error`"}
If true (the default when omitted) then an error thrown on the remote side of the connection causes an error to also be thrown locally. If false, the remote error is locally reported as a NOTICE, and the function\'s return value is set to `ERROR`.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns status, either `OK` or `ERROR`.

## Notes

If `dblink_open` started an explicit transaction block, and this is the last remaining open cursor in this connection, `dblink_close` will issue the matching `COMMIT`.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_connect('dbname=postgres options=-csearch_path=');
     dblink_connect
    ----------------
     OK
    (1 row)

    SELECT dblink_open('foo', 'select proname, prosrc from pg_proc');
     dblink_open
    -------------
     OK
    (1 row)

    SELECT dblink_close('foo');
     dblink_close
    --------------
     OK
    (1 row)

dblink_get_connections

3

dblink_get_connections

returns the names of all open named dblink connections

dblink_get_connections() returns text\[\]

## Description

`dblink_get_connections` returns an array of the names of all open named `dblink` connections.

## Return Value

Returns a text array of connection names, or NULL if none.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_get_connections();

dblink_error_message

3

dblink_error_message

gets last error message on the named connection

dblink_error_message(text connname) returns text

## Description

`dblink_error_message` fetches the most recent remote error message for a given connection.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
Name of the connection to use.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns last error message, or `OK` if there has been no error in this connection.

## Notes

When asynchronous queries are initiated by `dblink_send_query`, the error message associated with the connection might not get updated until the server\'s response message is consumed.
This typically means that `dblink_is_busy` or `dblink_get_result` should be called prior to `dblink_error_message`, so that any error generated by the asynchronous query will be visible.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_error_message('dtest1');

dblink_send_query

3

dblink_send_query

sends an async query to a remote database

dblink_send_query(text connname, text sql) returns int

## Description

`dblink_send_query` sends a query to be executed asynchronously, that is, without immediately waiting for the result.
There must not be an async query already in progress on the connection.

After successfully dispatching an async query, completion status can be checked with `dblink_is_busy`, and the results are ultimately collected with `dblink_get_result`.
It is also possible to attempt to cancel an active async query using `dblink_cancel_query`.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
Name of the connection to use.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`sql`"}
The SQL statement that you wish to execute in the remote database, for example `select * from pg_class`.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns 1 if the query was successfully dispatched, 0 otherwise.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_send_query('dtest1', 'SELECT * FROM foo WHERE f1 < 3');

dblink_is_busy

3

dblink_is_busy

checks if connection is busy with an async query

dblink_is_busy(text connname) returns int

## Description

`dblink_is_busy` tests whether an async query is in progress.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
Name of the connection to check.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns 1 if connection is busy, 0 if it is not busy.
If this function returns 0, it is guaranteed that `dblink_get_result` will not block.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_is_busy('dtest1');

dblink_get_notify

3

dblink_get_notify

retrieve async notifications on a connection

dblink_get_notify() returns setof (notify_name text, be_pid int, extra text) dblink_get_notify(text connname) returns setof (notify_name text, be_pid int, extra text)

## Description

`dblink_get_notify` retrieves notifications on either the unnamed connection, or on a named connection if specified.
To receive notifications via dblink, `LISTEN` must first be issued, using `dblink_exec`.
For details see [LISTEN](braised:ref/sql-listen) and [NOTIFY](braised:ref/sql-notify).

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
The name of a named connection to get notifications on.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns `setof (notify_name text, be_pid int, extra text)`, or an empty set if none.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_exec('LISTEN virtual');
     dblink_exec
    -------------
     LISTEN
    (1 row)

    SELECT * FROM dblink_get_notify();
     notify_name | be_pid | extra
    -------------+--------+-------
    (0 rows)

    NOTIFY virtual;
    NOTIFY

    SELECT * FROM dblink_get_notify();
     notify_name | be_pid | extra
    -------------+--------+-------
     virtual     |   1229 |
    (1 row)

dblink_get_result

3

dblink_get_result

gets an async query result

dblink_get_result(text connname \[, bool fail_on_error\]) returns setof record

## Description

`dblink_get_result` collects the results of an asynchronous query previously sent with `dblink_send_query`.
If the query is not already completed, `dblink_get_result` will wait until it is.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
Name of the connection to use.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`fail_on_error`"}
If true (the default when omitted) then an error thrown on the remote side of the connection causes an error to also be thrown locally. If false, the remote error is locally reported as a NOTICE, and the function returns no rows.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

For an async query (that is, an SQL statement returning rows), the function returns the row(s) produced by the query.
To use this function, you will need to specify the expected set of columns, as previously discussed for `dblink`.

For an async command (that is, an SQL statement not returning rows), the function returns a single row with a single text column containing the command\'s status string.
It is still necessary to specify that the result will have a single text column in the calling `FROM` clause.

## Notes

This function *must* be called if `dblink_send_query` returned 1.
It must be called once for each query sent, and one additional time to obtain an empty set result, before the connection can be used again.

When using `dblink_send_query` and `dblink_get_result`, dblink fetches the entire remote query result before returning any of it to the local query processor.
If the query returns a large number of rows, this can result in transient memory bloat in the local session.
It may be better to open such a query as a cursor with `dblink_open` and then fetch a manageable number of rows at a time.
Alternatively, use plain `dblink()`, which avoids memory bloat by spooling large result sets to disk.

## Examples

    contrib_regression=# SELECT dblink_connect('dtest1', 'dbname=contrib_regression');
     dblink_connect
    ----------------
     OK

dblink_cancel_query

3

dblink_cancel_query

cancels any active query on the named connection

dblink_cancel_query(text connname) returns text

## Description

`dblink_cancel_query` attempts to cancel any query that is in progress on the named connection.
Note that this is not certain to succeed (since, for example, the remote query might already have finished).
A cancel request simply improves the odds that the query will fail soon.
You must still complete the normal query protocol, for example by calling `dblink_get_result`.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`connname`"}
Name of the connection to use.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns `OK` if the cancel request has been sent, or the text of an error message on failure.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_cancel_query('dtest1');

dblink_get_pkey

3

dblink_get_pkey

returns the positions and field names of a relation\'s primary key fields

dblink_get_pkey(text relname) returns setof dblink_pkey_results

## Description

`dblink_get_pkey` provides information about the primary key of a relation in the local database.
This is sometimes useful in generating queries to be sent to remote databases.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`relname`"}
Name of a local relation, for example `foo` or `myschema.mytab`. Include double quotes if the name is mixed-case or contains special characters, for example `"FooBar"`; without quotes, the string will be folded to lower case.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns one row for each primary key field, or no rows if the relation has no primary key.
The result row type is defined as

    CREATE TYPE dblink_pkey_results AS (position int, colname text);

The `position` column simply runs from 1 to *N*; it is the number of the field within the primary key, not the number within the table\'s columns.

## Examples

    CREATE TABLE foobar (
        f1 int,
        f2 int,
        f3 int,
        PRIMARY KEY (f1, f2, f3)
    );
    CREATE TABLE

    SELECT * FROM dblink_get_pkey('foobar');
     position | colname
    ----------+---------
            1 | f1
            2 | f2
            3 | f3
    (3 rows)

dblink_build_sql_insert

3

dblink_build_sql_insert

builds an INSERT statement using a local tuple, replacing the primary key field values with alternative supplied values

dblink_build_sql_insert(text relname, int2vector primary_key_attnums, integer num_primary_key_atts, text\[\] src_pk_att_vals_array, text\[\] tgt_pk_att_vals_array) returns text

## Description

`dblink_build_sql_insert` can be useful in doing selective replication of a local table to a remote database.
It selects a row from the local table based on primary key, and then builds an SQL `INSERT` command that will duplicate that row, but with the primary key values replaced by the values in the last argument. (To make an exact copy of the row, just specify the same values for the last two arguments.)

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`relname`"}
Name of a local relation, for example `foo` or `myschema.mytab`. Include double quotes if the name is mixed-case or contains special characters, for example `"FooBar"`; without quotes, the string will be folded to lower case.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`primary_key_attnums`"}
Attribute numbers (1-based) of the primary key fields, for example `1 2`.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`num_primary_key_atts`"}
The number of primary key fields.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`src_pk_att_vals_array`"}
Values of the primary key fields to be used to look up the local tuple. Each field is represented in text form. An error is thrown if there is no local row with these primary key values.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`tgt_pk_att_vals_array`"}
Values of the primary key fields to be placed in the resulting `INSERT` command. Each field is represented in text form.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns the requested SQL statement as text.

## Notes

As of PostgreSQL 9.0, the attribute numbers in `primary_key_attnums` are interpreted as logical column numbers, corresponding to the column\'s position in `SELECT * FROM relname`.
Previous versions interpreted the numbers as physical column positions.
There is a difference if any column(s) to the left of the indicated column have been dropped during the lifetime of the table.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_build_sql_insert('foo', '1 2', 2, '{"1", "a"}', '{"1", "b''a"}');
                 dblink_build_sql_insert
    --------------------------------------------------
     INSERT INTO foo(f1,f2,f3) VALUES('1','b''a','1')
    (1 row)

dblink_build_sql_delete

3

dblink_build_sql_delete

builds a DELETE statement using supplied values for primary key field values

dblink_build_sql_delete(text relname, int2vector primary_key_attnums, integer num_primary_key_atts, text\[\] tgt_pk_att_vals_array) returns text

## Description

`dblink_build_sql_delete` can be useful in doing selective replication of a local table to a remote database.
It builds an SQL `DELETE` command that will delete the row with the given primary key values.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`relname`"}
Name of a local relation, for example `foo` or `myschema.mytab`. Include double quotes if the name is mixed-case or contains special characters, for example `"FooBar"`; without quotes, the string will be folded to lower case.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`primary_key_attnums`"}
Attribute numbers (1-based) of the primary key fields, for example `1 2`.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`num_primary_key_atts`"}
The number of primary key fields.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`tgt_pk_att_vals_array`"}
Values of the primary key fields to be used in the resulting `DELETE` command. Each field is represented in text form.
:::{/item}
:::{/dl}

## Return Value

Returns the requested SQL statement as text.

## Notes

As of PostgreSQL 9.0, the attribute numbers in `primary_key_attnums` are interpreted as logical column numbers, corresponding to the column\'s position in `SELECT * FROM relname`.
Previous versions interpreted the numbers as physical column positions.
There is a difference if any column(s) to the left of the indicated column have been dropped during the lifetime of the table.

## Examples

    SELECT dblink_build_sql_delete('"MyFoo"', '1 2', 2, '{"1", "b"}');
               dblink_build_sql_delete
    ---------------------------------------------
     DELETE FROM "MyFoo" WHERE f1='1' AND f2='b'
    (1 row)

dblink_build_sql_update

3

dblink_build_sql_update

builds an UPDATE statement using a local tuple, replacing the primary key field values with alternative supplied values

dblink_build_sql_update(text relname, int2vector primary_key_attnums, integer num_primary_key_atts, text\[\] src_pk_att_vals_array, text\[\] tgt_pk_att_vals_array) returns text

## Description

`dblink_build_sql_update` can be useful in doing selective replication of a local table to a remote database.
It selects a row from the local table based on primary key, and then builds an SQL `UPDATE` command that will duplicate that row, but with the primary key values replaced by the values in the last argument. (To make an exact copy of the row, just specify the same values for the last two arguments.) The `UPDATE` command always assigns all fields of the row the main difference between this and `dblink_build_sql_insert` is that it\'s assumed that the target row already exists in the remote table.

## Arguments

:::{.dl}
:::{.item term="`relname`"}
Name of a local relation, for example `foo` or `myschema.mytab`. Include double quotes if the name is mixed-case or contains special characters, for example `"FooBar"`; without quotes, the string will be folded to lower case.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`primary_key_attnums`"}
Attribute numbers (1-based) of the primary key fields, for example `1 2`.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`num_primary_key_atts`"}
The number of primary key fields.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`src_pk_att_vals_array`"}
Values of the primary key fields to be used to look up the local tuple. Each field is represented in text form. An error is thrown if there is no local row with these primary key values.
:::{/item}
:::{.item term="`tgt_pk_att_vals_array`"}

                       dblink_build_sql_update
    -------------------------------------------------------------
     UPDATE foo SET f1='1',f2='b',f3='1' WHERE f1='1' AND f2='b'
